   git status

2) Spin up Wow on an Alliance and a Horde toon Retail/Classic and do:
   /run WoWPro:LoadAllGuides()
   This verifies that all guides can be parsed.

3) Look at <WOW>/Logs/FrameXML.log for errors

4) Update Release notes in Notes.md and check in.

5) Generate zip files (you will be prompted for the tag to use):
   WoWPro_Utilities/CutReleases.sh

6) Upload the Trial versions to CurseForge.com
